Filter posts through multiple taxonomies

== Description ==

Say you have two custom taxnomies defined: genre and artist.

Currently, you can do the following types of queries on your site:

`?genre=jazz`

`?genre=jazz&cat=1`

But you can't do this:

`?genre=jazz&artist=chet-baker`

WordPress will just ignore one of the parameters. This plugin fixes that.

It also comes with a drill-down navigation widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I define a custom taxonomy? =

Try the [Simple Taxonomies](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-taxonomies) plugin.

= How can I customize the display? =

Firstly, you have the `is_multitax()` conditional tag, that works similarly to `is_tax()`.

Secondly, you can create a `multitax.php` template file in your theme.
