Customise the order your posts are display in using this simple drag-and-drop Ajax interface, tweaked to allow admin sorting by category/date.

== Description ==
Posts are usually listed in reverse chronological order as they are often used for posting regular time-orientated content.

postMash (by Joel Starnes) lets you customise the order your posts are listed in using it's simple Ajax drag-and-drop administrative interface. Plus it gives quick access to toggle posts between draft and published states. Particularly useful if you're using WordPress as a CMS.

postMash (filtered) provides some key modification tweaks to the original plugin. 

1) You can now filter all posts by category & date from the admin panel, where previously you had to work from a full list of all published posts

2) Addition of new function to allow you to call the 'Next Post' and 'Previous Post' links in your 'single.php' theme file to match the order you set in postMash, instead of the default (by date).

3) there is a brief instruction on how to allow viewing of posts in the regular 'Edit Posts' admin window in the same order as they appear on postMash and, if set, your blog.

== Installation ==

To make use of this chosen order you will need to modify your template code:
Open wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/index.php and find the beginning of ‘the loop’. Which will start: `if(have_posts())`. Then add the following code directly before this:
`
<?php  
    $wp_query->set('orderby', 'menu_order');  
    $wp_query->set('order', 'ASC');  
    $wp_query->get_posts();  
?>
`


This just tells WP to get the posts ordered according to their ‘menu_order’ position. Therefore you can get the posts ordered anytime you use a function such as get_posts simply by giving it the required arguments:


`
<?php get_posts('orderby=menu_order&order=ASC'); ?>
`

Checkout the get_posts() function in the wordpress codex for more info.
Note that it says menu_order is only useful for pages, posts have a menu_order position too, it just isn’t used. postMash provides you with an iterface so that you can use it.

NEXT POST AND PREVIOUS POST LINKS

ALSO You can now use the 'Next Post' and 'Previous Post' calls in your template file 'single.php', as usual, but rather than calling items by date, it will call items using the same order as set in postMash,  using the following modified commands in place of the regular tags

`
ORIGINAL TAGS

	next_post_link(); 
	previous_post_link();

MODIFIED TAGS

	next_post_link_menu(); 
	previous_post_link_menu();
`

(Please note that, by default, 'In Same Category' is set to TRUE. You will need to edit this if you wish to disable it. All other variables passed to the function should work as normal)


OPTIONAL ADMIN INSTALLATION 

If you wish to view the posts in the Wordpress admin 'Edit Posts' panel in the same order as you have set them postMash (rather than the default 'Date Published' or 'Date Modified'), you can modify wp-admin/includes/post.php, on line 784 as follows;

`
ORIGINAL

	if ( isset($q['post_status']) && 'pending' === $q['post_status'] ) {
		$order = 'ASC';
		$orderby = 'modified';
	} elseif ( isset($q['post_status']) && 'draft' === $q['post_status'] ) {
		$order = 'DESC';
		$orderby = 'modified';
	} else {
		$order = 'DESC';
		$orderby = 'date';
	}
	
	
MODIFIED

	if ( isset($q['post_status']) && 'pending' === $q['post_status'] ) {
		$order = 'ASC';
		$orderby = 'menu_order';
	} elseif ( isset($q['post_status']) && 'draft' === $q['post_status'] ) {
		$order = 'ASC';
		$orderby = 'menu_order';
	} else {
		$order = 'ASC';
		$orderby = 'menu_order';
	}

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= None of it's working =
The most likely cause is that you have another plugin which has included an incompatible javascript library onto the postMash admin page.

Try opening up your WP admin and browse to your postMash page, then take a look at the page source. Check if the prototype or scriptaculous scripts are included in the header. If so then the next step is to track down the offending plugin, which you can do by disabling each of your plugins in turn and checking when the scripts are no longer included.

= Do I need any special code in my template =
Yes, by default posts are shown in reverse chronological order, to show the posts in the order you set in postMash you will need to use different code to display your posts. Look in the install section for an example.

= Which browsers are supported =
Any good up-to-date browser should work fine. I test in Firefox, IE7, Safari and Opera.
